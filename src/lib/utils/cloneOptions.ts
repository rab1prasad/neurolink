/**
 * The set of top-level branches on a `StreamOptions` / `GenerateOptions`
 * / `DynamicOptions` bag that downstream prep stages mutate. Listed here
 * once so the runtime clone (`cloneOptionsForCallIsolation`) and any
 * future test that wants to assert call isolation reference the same
 * source of truth.
 *
 * If you add a new top-level field to `StreamOptions` that gets mutated
 * by prepareStreamOptions / applyStreamOrchestration / RAG/MCP injection
 * / memory retrieval / etc., add it here AND add an entry to
 * `test/helpers/cloneOptions.test.ts` so the isolation guarantee gets
 * exercised.
 *
 * Branches that are deliberately NOT cloned (and why):
 *   - `signal` / `abortSignal` — `AbortSignal` can't be `structuredClone`d
 *     and a shallow copy would strip the listener wiring.
 *   - `tools[name].execute` — function identity is used as a cache key
 *     downstream; cloning would break that.
 *   - schema objects (zod / JSON Schema) — large, frequently frozen,
 *     and not mutated by NeuroLink internals.
