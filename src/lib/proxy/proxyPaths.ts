/**
 * Proxy file path resolver.
 *
 * In normal mode, all paths resolve under ~/.neurolink/.
 * In dev mode (--dev), writable paths resolve under <cwd>/.neurolink-dev/
 * so a local dev proxy never touches the global proxy's state.
 *
 * Read-only paths (like .env) always point to the global location
 * since credentials must be shared.
 *
 * NOTE: Claude Code header snapshots (~/.neurolink/header-snapshots/) are
 * not redirected in dev mode. They are only written when a real Claude Code
 * client connects, which typically does not happen during dev testing.
