Create a summary with the following sections:

### 1. Primary Request and Intent
What is the user's main goal or request? What are they trying to accomplish?

### 2. Key Technical Concepts
What technologies, frameworks, patterns, or concepts are central to this conversation?

### 3. Files and Code Sections
What specific files, functions, or code sections have been discussed or modified?

### 4. Problem Solving
What problems were identified? What solutions were attempted or implemented?

### 5. Pending Tasks
What tasks remain incomplete or need follow-up?

### 6. Task Evolution
How has the task changed or evolved during the conversation?

### 7. Current Work
What is being actively worked on right now?

### 8. Next Step
What is the immediate next action to take?

### 9. Required Files
What files will need to be accessed or modified to continue?

### 10. Constraints and Established Rules
What user-imposed constraints, behavioral directives, coding standards, agreed-upon decisions, or established rules must persist across the conversation? Include any "always do X", "never do Y", naming conventions, architectural patterns, or preferences the user has stated.${fileContext}

IMPORTANT: Section 10 (Constraints and Established Rules) must ALWAYS be preserved in full. User constraints and established agreements are never "no longer relevant" — they remain in effect for the entire session unless the user explicitly revokes them.

Analyze the conversation thoroughly and fill in each section with relevant information. If a section is not applicable, write "N/A" for that section.`;

Existing Summary:

Update sections with new information while preserving important context from the existing summary. Maintain the same 10-section structure.

Instructions:
1. Review the existing summary above
2. Analyze the new conversation content
3. MERGE the new information into the appropriate sections
4. Update sections with relevant new information
5. Remove information that is no longer relevant EXCEPT for Section 10 (Constraints and Established Rules) — user constraints and established agreements must ALWAYS be preserved unless the user explicitly revoked them
6. Keep the summary concise but comprehensive
7. Maintain the 10-section format
8. Always carry forward ALL entries from Section 10 of the existing summary, adding any new constraints found in the new content${fileContext}

Output the updated summary following the same 10-section structure.`;
