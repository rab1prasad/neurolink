## Medium-priority issues (resolved in PR)

### ~~MED-1~~ ✅ Resolved: TS-cast escape replaced by `refreshHandlersForModel`

`BaseProvider.modelName` is no longer `readonly`. A new `protected refreshHandlersForModel(model)` rebuilds the composed handlers (`MessageBuilder`, `StreamHandler`, `TelemetryHandler`, `GenerationHandler`, `Utilities`) and pushes the resolved model onto the active OTEL span. Both `lmStudio.ts` and `llamaCpp.ts` call it after `/v1/models` discovery, so pricing / span / log metadata always reports the actual loaded model. The `(this as unknown as { modelName: string })` workaround is gone from both files.

### MED-2: `getOutputReserve` — kept honest, mitigation moved to tests

The original plan was to clamp `getOutputReserve` to `min(maxTokens, contextWindow * 0.8)`. That clamp was attempted and then reverted: `getAvailableInputTokens()` (used by `BudgetChecker`, conversation-memory pruning, and `fileSummarizer`) would have advertised more input headroom than the actual outgoing request allowed, letting oversized prompts pass preflight then fail upstream. `getOutputReserve` now returns the real `maxTokens` so preflight matches the request. The active mitigation for the test-only `maxTokens === contextWindow` pattern is the per-suite `PROVIDER_MAX_TOKENS[…] || 1024` fallback (12 test files + `continuous-test-suite.ts:5099`).

## Low-priority / style notes

### LOW-1: Provider files have logger reference before its import statement

```ts
// llamaCpp.ts:10
const makeLoggingFetch = (provider: string): typeof fetch => {
  const base = createProxyFetch();
  return (async (input, init) => {
    ...
    if (!response.ok) {
      ...
      logger.warn(`[${provider}] upstream ${response.status}`, ...);  // ← logger used here
    }
    return response;
  }) as typeof fetch;
};
import type { ... } from "../types/index.js";
...
import { logger } from "../utils/logger.js";  // ← imported AFTER
```

JavaScript hoists ES imports to top of module, so this works at runtime. But it's confusing to read. Recommend reordering: all imports first, then the helper function.

Affects: `deepseek.ts`, `nvidiaNim.ts`, `lmStudio.ts`, `llamaCpp.ts`.

### LOW-2: `console.error` calls in production code (lmStudio.ts only)

```ts
// lmStudio.ts:30 inside makeLoggingFetch
console.error(
  `[${provider}] upstream ${response.status} url=${url} req=${reqBody} resp=${body.slice(0, 400)}`,
);
```

This was added to capture upstream errors that the logger filtered. The eslint-disable is in place. But user code shouldn't see raw `console.error` — `logger.error(...)` should suffice, or the logger filter should be relaxed for this category.

**Recommendation:** Replace with `logger.error(...)` or `logger.shouldLog("error") && logger.error(...)`.

### LOW-3: NIM extra-body retry-on-400 logic could be a `reduceUntilSuccess` helper

```ts
// nvidiaNim.ts:280-300 — manual retry when reasoning_budget or chat_template is rejected
let result;
try {
  result = await callStream(extraBody);
} catch (error) {
  ...
  if (status === 400) {
    if (lower.includes("reasoning_budget")) {
      extraBody = stripReasoningBudget(extraBody);
      result = await callStream(extraBody);
    } else if (lower.includes("chat_template")) {
      extraBody = stripChatTemplate(extraBody);
      result = await callStream(extraBody);
    } else { throw error; }
  } else { throw error; }
}
```

Works fine for 2 strip steps but doesn't generalize. If NIM adds another rejected field, this needs another nested `if`. Future improvement: a list of `{ matcher, stripper }` entries iterated until success.

**Recommendation:** Ship as-is; refactor if more strip steps appear.

### LOW-4: Tests test-results-v3..v12 dirs are deleted but referenced in `docs/provider-integration/10-test-results-final.md`

The doc's "Iteration table" mentions `test-results-v{2..13}/` paths that no longer exist. Either:

- Update the doc to remove the table
- Or note "Per-iteration results not committed; final summary above is the canonical reference"

**Recommendation:** Light edit to `10-test-results-final.md` to clarify.

## Strengths

1. **Clean separation of concerns:** new providers in their own files, registrations in registry, types in canonical location — exactly what CLAUDE.md prescribes.
2. **Comprehensive error formatting:** each provider's `formatProviderError` covers auth, rate limit, model-not-found, balance/quota, network — with friendly URLs to fix.
3. **OTEL tracing wrapper consistent:** all 4 use `withClientStreamSpan` with proper `gen_ai.*` attrs (matches existing providers like openAI.ts). NOTE: this used to recommend `withClientSpan`; that helper ends the span when its callback resolves, which captures only setup time for streaming methods. Always prefer the `*StreamSpan` variant for `executeStream`.
4. **The `_default` pricing fix is well-scoped:** filters `_default` out of prefix matches, only used as last-resort fallback. Doesn't affect existing per-model entries.
5. **Test-infra fixes have clear comments** explaining the bug (Budget=0) and the rationale for the 8192→1024 number.
6. **Documentation is thorough:** 13 markdown files including architecture, per-provider notes, testing, and a full failure investigation report.
7. **All commits will be self-contained:** tests pass, typecheck passes, lint passes (with only pre-existing warnings).

## Security review

- ✅ API keys read from env vars (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY`)
- ✅ `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL` and `LLAMACPP_BASE_URL` default to localhost; not auto-exposed
- ✅ `makeLoggingFetch` truncates request bodies to 600 chars and response bodies to 400 chars in logs (limits leak of large payloads)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in tests
- ✅ Per-call credentials honored (per `NeurolinkCredentials` slice)

✅ **Note:** `makeLoggingFetch` writes request/response body excerpts to stderr only on non-2xx responses **and** only when `NEUROLINK_DEBUG_HTTP=1` is set. Default behavior logs status/url/reqSize only — no body capture — so user prompts to paid providers (DeepSeek/NIM) cannot leak to stderr in production unless an operator opts in.

---

## Backward compatibility

- ✅ No breaking changes to public SDK API. Existing callers still work.
- ✅ `pricing.ts` `_default` change: only adds a NEW fallback step at the end of the chain. Existing providers that don't have `_default` are unaffected (their lookup behavior is identical).
- ✅ `AIProviderName` enum extended (additive). Existing values unchanged.
- ✅ `NeurolinkCredentials` extended (additive).
- ✅ Tests modified are test-only files; not shipped in npm package.

---

## Final recommendation

✅ **Approve.** MED-1 (mutable `BaseProvider.modelName` + `refreshHandlersForModel`) is shipped; MED-2 (`getOutputReserve` clamp) was attempted and reverted in favor of the per-suite `… || 1024` test-fallback fix — see the entries above. Optional polish before merge:

- Reorder imports/helpers in 4 provider files (LOW-1)
- Update `10-test-results-final.md` to remove dead test-results-v\* references (LOW-4)
