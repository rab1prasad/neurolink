   - If you have ideas on how to fix the vulnerability

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports in a timely manner:

- **Initial acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment:** Within 72 hours
- **Fix timeline:** Based on severity (see below)
- **Public disclosure:** After fix is released and users have had time to update

### Severity Levels and Fix Timeline

| Severity | Description                            | Fix Timeline       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Critical | Affects all users, active exploitation | 1-7 days           |
| High     | Affects most users, easy to exploit    | 7-14 days          |
| Medium   | Limited impact or difficult to exploit | 14-30 days         |
| Low      | Minimal impact                         | Next release cycle |

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using NeuroLink in production, follow these security best practices:

### API Key Management

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use separate keys for development and production
- Consider using a secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Security

NeuroLink includes a production-ready HITL system for high-stakes operations:

```typescript
import { NeuroLink } from "@juspay/neurolink";

const neurolink = new NeuroLink({
  hitl: {
    enabled: true,
    dangerousActions: [
      "write",
      "execute",
      "send",
      "delete",
      "database",
      "drop",
      "truncate",
    ],
    timeout: 60000, // 60 seconds for user response
    autoApproveOnTimeout: false, // Reject on timeout for safety
    allowArgumentModification: true, // Allow users to modify tool arguments
    auditLogging: true, // Enable audit logs for compliance
  },
});

// Listen for confirmation requests using events
const emitter = neurolink.getEventEmitter();
emitter.on("hitl:confirmation-request", async (event) => {
  const { confirmationId, toolName, arguments: args } = event.payload;

  // Integrate with your approval system
  const approved = await yourApprovalSystem.requestReview({
    tool: toolName,
    arguments: args,
  });

  // Respond with confirmation
  emitter.emit("hitl:confirmation-response", {
    type: "hitl:confirmation-response",
    payload: {
      confirmationId,
      approved,
      reason: approved ? undefined : "Denied by security policy",
      metadata: { timestamp: new Date().toISOString() },
    },
  });
});
```

**Use HITL for:**

- Financial transactions
- Data modifications
- Code execution
- Email/notification sending
- Database operations in production

### Redis Security

If using Redis for conversation memory:

- **Enable authentication:** Always set a strong Redis password
- **Use TLS:** Enable TLS/SSL for production Redis connections
- **Network isolation:** Keep Redis on a private network
- **Regular updates:** Keep Redis version up to date

```typescript
const neurolink = new NeuroLink({
  conversationMemory: {
    enabled: true,
    store: "redis",
    redis: {
      host: "redis.example.com",
      port: 6379,
      password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
      tls: true, // Always enable for production
    },
  },
});
```

### Middleware Security

When implementing custom middleware:

- **Validate all inputs:** Never trust user input
- **Sanitize outputs:** Clean data before logging or displaying
- **Rate limiting:** Implement rate limits to prevent abuse
- **Error handling:** Don't leak sensitive information in error messages

### Provider Security

- **Use least privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions to provider API keys
- **Monitor usage:** Track API usage for anomalies
- **Budget limits:** Set spending limits on provider accounts
- **Audit logs:** Enable audit logging for all provider interactions

## Security Features in NeuroLink

NeuroLink includes enterprise-grade security features:

### Audit Trail

Full audit logging for compliance (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR):

```typescript
const neurolink = new NeuroLink({
  enableAnalytics: true, // Captures full request/response data
  hitl: {
    enabled: true,
    auditLogging: true, // Logs all approval decisions
  },
});
```

### Guardrails Middleware

Built-in content filtering and safety using the MiddlewareFactory:

```typescript
import { MiddlewareFactory } from "@juspay/neurolink";

// Create middleware factory with guardrails configuration
const factory = new MiddlewareFactory({
  enabledMiddleware: ["guardrails"],
  middlewareConfig: {
    guardrails: {
      enabled: true,
      config: {
        badWords: {
          enabled: true,
          list: ["harmful", "dangerous", "unsafe"],
        },
        modelFilter: {
          enabled: true,
          filterModel: "gpt-3.5-turbo", // Use a fast model for content filtering
        },
        precallEvaluation: {
          enabled: true,
          provider: "openai",
          evaluationModel: "gpt-4",
          thresholds: {
            safetyScore: 7,
            appropriatenessScore: 6,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

// Use in your NeuroLink instance
const result = await neurolink.generate({
  input: { text: "Your prompt" },
  middleware: factory,
});
```
